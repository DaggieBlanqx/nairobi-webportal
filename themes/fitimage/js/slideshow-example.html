                <h2>New Crude Oil Transmission Technology</h2>
                <h3>AOT™ Midstream and AOT™ Upstream</h3>
                <p>Applied Oil Technology (AOT™) improves the flow of industrial crude oil down pipelines via a unique and revolutionary form of viscosity reduction. AOT™ is on track to be implemented in the North American market.</p>
